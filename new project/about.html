        <h1>About Luca's Loaves</h1>
        <p>Luca commenced his career as a lifeguard but was laid off. He found he enjoyed making bread and experimented, and in no time at all had built up a thriving business.</p>

        <h2>About Sourdough Bread</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It has no store/commercial yeast.</li>
            <li>Hand kneaded and shaped in-house.</li>
            <li>Prepared over 14-17 hours.</li>
            <li>Uses organic flour, filtered water, and solar-powered electricity for baking.</li>
            <li>Store-bought bread is mixed and baked within 2 hours, leading to high gluten content. This can make it harder to digest, while sourdough is a great alternative and easier to digest.</li>
        </ul>
